# DOCUMENTATION

Here is a documentation aiming at providing detailed information about Packetgraph's brick concept, about implemented technologies/features (with standards descriptions) and about each brick. The idea is to explain what's the purpose of each component, further optimizations and choices made.<br>
All this documentation must be written in ASCII so we can access it through a terminal.<br>

An overview of the general concept of packetgraph:
* [General concept.](PG_GENERAL_CONCEPT.md)

Detailed brick linking information and shema are availables here:

For specific brick'informations and shemas:
* [VHOST brick.](VHOST.md)
* [RXTX brick.](RXTX.md)
* [VTEP brick.](VTEP.md)
* [SWITCH brick.](SWITCH.md)
